This folder demonstrates my progress in learning 3D visualization with Blender, which I started learning in January 2023.



## Hot keys cheat sheet

G - grab (used to move objects, you can click X,Y,Z to move along an axis)  <br />
click OBJECT + R - rotate  <br />
click OBJECT + S - scale  <br />


## Emulate Numberpad

On Mac some of the hot keys will not work, so to emulate the numberpad you need to do the following:  <br />
```Edit-> Preferences->Input->Emulate Numpad```
