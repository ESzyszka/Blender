# Blender
This folder demonstrates my progress in learning 3D visualization with Blender, which I started learning in January 2023.



## Hot keys cheat sheet

```G``` - grab (used to move objects, you can click X,Y,Z to move along an axis)  <br />
```click OBJECT + R``` - rotate  <br />
```click OBJECT + S``` - scale  <br />
```0``` - camera view
```SHIFT + A``` - add
```TAB``` - edit mode


## Emulate Numberpad

On Mac some of the hot keys will not work, so to emulate the numberpad you need to do the following:  <br />
```Edit-> Preferences->Input->Emulate Numpad```


## General good practices

### 0.1 Scale
Before you start the project set up the scale.
You can do this by clicking ```S``` to rescale the object. You can also see this panel on the right side. 
The scale will not be equal to 1 by default. This is something that you need to change. <br />
```click OBJECT + CONTROL + A -> scale```<br />

### 0.2 Shading
There are two types of shading in Blender: 

```Shade smooth```<br />

```Shade flat``` <br />

### 0.3 Selecting mesh

```TAB``` to go to the edit mode, then click on ```Toggle x-ray``` tool in right upper corner, now you can select an object / part of the object
