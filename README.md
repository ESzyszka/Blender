# Blender
This folder demonstrates my progress in learning 3D visualization with Blender, which I started learning in January 2023.



## Hot keys cheat sheet

```G``` - grab (used to move objects, you can click X,Y,Z to move along an axis)  <br />
```click OBJECT + R``` - rotate  <br />
```click OBJECT + S``` - scale  <br />
```0``` - camera view <br />
```SHIFT + A``` - add <br />
```TAB``` - edit mode <br />
```H``` - hide  <br />
```OPTION + H ``` - reverse hide <br />
``` E ``` - extrude <br />
```M``` - move (way to create a new Collection/ Blender folder)

## Sculpting mode hot keys

```F``` - change the size of the brush
 

## Emulate Numberpad

On Mac some of the hot keys will not work, so to emulate the numberpad you need to do the following:  <br />
```Edit-> Preferences->Input->Emulate Numpad```


## General good practices

### 0.1 Scale
Before you start the project set up the scale.
You can do this by clicking ```S``` to rescale the object. You can also see this panel on the right side. 
The scale will not be equal to 1 by default. This is something that you need to change. <br />
```click OBJECT + CONTROL + A -> scale```<br />

### 0.2 Shading
There are two types of shading in Blender: 

```Shade smooth```<br />

```Shade flat``` <br />

### 0.3 Selecting mesh

```TAB``` to go to the edit mode, then click on ```Toggle x-ray``` tool in right upper corner, now you can select an object / part of the object

### 0.4 Selecting vertices

```TAB``` to enter the edit mode, then ```OPTION + SELECT``` - select only some vertices

### 0.5 Snapping tool

If you want to extend an object over another object you can use the snapping tool. To do so in ```edit mode``` go to snapping tool in the top bar and select ```snap to face``` <br />

### 0.6 Duplicating items

```OPTION + D``` - duplicate 

### Parenting items
 
Select ```child item``` first, then ```COMMAND + P```, next select the parent object and do the same short cut. You first select objects that are surposed to follow the parent. 


## 3D modelling terminology

## 0.1 Unbiased vs biased rendering engine

Cycles render engine (unbiased)
EEvee render engine (biased/ real time)

## 0.2 Raytracing

## 0.3 Retopology

Way of simplifying the polygons of a 3D model. It is used before animating 3D objects
